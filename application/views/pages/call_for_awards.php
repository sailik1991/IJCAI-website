<br><br>
The IJCAI Computer and Thought Award, the Research Excellence Award,
and the John McCarthy Award are among the highest recognitions any AI
researcher may receive. The call for the 2016 awards is now open, and
nominations are warmly welcomed.

<br><br>
AWARD FOR RESEARCH EXCELLENCE
<br><br>

The Research Excellence award is given to a scientist who has carried
out a program of research of consistently high quality throughout an
entire career yielding several substantial results. Past recipients of
this honor are the most illustrious group of scientists from the field
of Artificial Intelligence.

<br><br>
COMPUTERS AND THOUGHT AWARD
<br><br>

The Computers and Thought Award is presented at IJCAI conferences to
outstanding young scientists in artificial intelligence.  The award
was established with royalties received from the book, Computers and
Thought, edited by Edward Feigenbaum and Julian Feldman. It is
currently supported by income from IJCAI funds.

<br><br>
JOHN McCARTHY AWARD
<br><br>

This award is intended to recognize established mid-career researchers
that have built up a major track record of research excellence in
artificial intelligence. Recipients of the award will have made
significant contributions to the research agenda in their area and
will have a first-rate profile of influential research results.  The
award is named for John McCarthy (1927-2011), who is widely recognized
as one of the founders of the field of artificial intelligence. As
well as giving the discipline its name, McCarthy made fundamental
contributions of lasting importance to computer science in general and
artificial intelligence in particular, including time-sharing
operating systems, the LISP programming languages, knowledge
representation, common-sense reasoning, and the logicist paradigm in
artificial intelligence.  The award was established with the full
support and encouragement of the McCarthy family.

<br><br>
