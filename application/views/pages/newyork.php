	<strong>Manhattan</strong>
				<br>
				<br>

				The central location of IJCAI-16 will afford conference attendees accessibility to all that New York
				has to offer! Manhattan's extraordinary cityscape provides a dramatic charge for people of all
				interests and ages. Powerfully compact at 13.5 miles long, the borough is filled with soaring
				skyscrapers, glamorous neighborhoods, shops and restaurants, with the magnificent 843-acre
				<b>Central Park</b> - a National Historic Landmark - at its heart. Before or after an event, groups
				can sample Manhattan's iconic cultural masterpieces - <b>The Metropolitan Museum of Art, Museum of
				Modern Art and the Guggenheim Museum </b> - or experience a live show on <b>Broadway </b>, at Lincoln Center,
				a TV studio or in jazz clubs from Harlem to Greenwich Village. The list of key landmarks is topped
				by the <b> Statue of Liberty, the Empire State Building, Times Square, South Street Seaport,
				The Cloisters and Rockefeller Center</b>. Whether one chooses to shop, dine or just people-watch,
				there's truly no place like Manhattan.

				Travel Tips
				<br>
				
				<i>Airports / Accessibility</i>
				<br>
				Getting to New York City from anywhere is quick and affordable. With three major airports and a combined total of over 20,000 flights per week, plus a comprehensive East Coast transit system, domestic and international attendees can get to NYC with ease.

				<br>
				Airports distance from Midtown:
				<br>

				<b>La Guardia</b> (8 miles)
				<br>
				<b>JFK</b> (15 miles)
				<br>
				<b>Newark</b> (16 miles)
				<br>
				<i>Airport Transportation</i>
				<br>
				<b>AirTrain JFK</b> is the easiest way to travel to, from and around Kennedy International Airport. AirTrain connects with MTA New York City Transit subways and buses and the Long Island Rail Road, providing a low-cost way to travel by mass transit to major destinations in New York and New Jersey. AirTrain makes frequent stops everywhere around the airport: airline terminals, parking lots, hotel shuttle areas and rental car facilities. AirTrain rides around the airport are free. The service operates 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.

				<br>
				<br>
				<b>Destination:</b> Midtown Manhattan, New York Penn Station
				<br>
				<b>Connection:</b> MTA NYC Transit E Subway at Jamaica Station
				<br>
				<b>Cost / Time:</b> $7.50 / 50 minutes
				<br>
				Trains from <b>Newark Airport</b> to Penn Station are $12.50 one way / 25 minutes
				<br>
				Taxis and shuttles are readily available from all airports
				<br>

				<br>
				<i>Trains / Accessibility </i>
				<br>
				<b>Amtrak:</b> America's national railroad operates several lines out of New York Penn Station, including the high-speed Acela. Penn Station is located under Madison Square Garden on West 34th Street, right in the heart of Midtown Manhattan. Amtrak offers an average of 85 daily trips into NYC from 200 destinations.

				<br>
				<br>
				<b>Commuter Transportation:</b> There are four local commuter trains in addition to an array of bus lines that provide easy access to NYC from the tristate area. NJ Transit, the Long Island Rail Road, Metro-North Railroad and the PATH (Port Authority Trans-Hudson) all run directly into NYC's two main rail stations, Penn Station and Grand Central Terminal.
				<br>
				<br>
				Ground Transportation
				<br>
				Subway System: MTA public subways remain the cheapest and quickest way to travel around the five boroughs. Operating in all five boroughs and carrying 7 million riders daily, the subway-the largest system in the world-is the heart of city transit. Trains operate 24/7. The cost of a single ride is $2.75; unlimited pass options are also available.
				<br>

				<br><b>Bus System:</b> MTA public buses can be accessed from almost every other city block and also operate 24 hours. Public buses are a scenic way to see the City and reach destinations not convenient to a subway stop.

				<br>
				<br>
				<b>Taxicabs:</b> Cabs can be hailed in any location and will drop you off exactly where you need to go. There is a minimum meter fare of $3, with price increases based on a set time-cost formula based on the time of day. All taxis accept cash and credit cards for payment.
