  <p>
        IJCAI-16 invites proposals for the Tutorial Track. Tutorials will be held on July 9-11, 2016, immediately prior to the technical conference. Attendance of the tutorials will be included in the IJCAI-16 conference registration fee and will not incur any additional fees. 

       <br><br><strong> Objectives: </strong>
  
       <br> <br> Tutorials should serve one or more of the following objectives: <br>

  
        <br>    &#8226 Introduce novices to major topics of Artificial Intelligence. </li>
	<br>	&#8226 Introduce expert non-specialists to an AI subarea.</li>
	<br>	&#8226 Motivate and explain a topic of emerging importance for AI.</li>
	<br>	&#8226 Survey a mature area of AI research and/or practice.</li>
        <br>	&#8226 Provide instruction in established but specialized AI methodologies. </li>
        <br>	&#8226 Present a novel synthesis combining distinct lines of AI work.</li>
        <br>	&#8226 Introduce AI audience to an external topic that can motivate or use AI research.</li>
        <br>	&#8226 Mentor AI researchers (particularly, junior researchers) on a broad AI-relevant non-technical topic (examples could be AI jobs, or ethical issues in AI).</li>
       
  
<br><br> We especially encourage tutorials with a hands-on component.
